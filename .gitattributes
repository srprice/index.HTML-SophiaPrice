<h3>Behind The Project</h3>

<p>"I think overall this song is about finding closure without really getting closure-- this whole project is. I felt like I had no choice but to write my own conclusions, answer my own questions, connecting the dots till I felt OK. It's hard because how do you ask someone to give you closure when you feel like you don't even have a right to know and ask? That's easy, you don't ask. You just have to learn how to heal without. I wrote my side of the story, without them and they might not agree with the way I'm seeing and that's OK. I think to some extent, in the moment and in the relationship, we give people those chances to show us and when they don't, that's where it all falls apart."
